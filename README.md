Okay, so I just staggered out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Until Dawn, and let me tell you, my brain feels like it's been thrown in a blender. First off, who writes this stuff? I mean, it’s like they took a bunch of horror tropes, threw them in a pot, added some teen drama spice, and just... let it simmer for two hours. Not gonna lie, I’m kind of exhausted, like I just pulled a red-eye shift. Plus, did anyone else feel this movie didn't decide what it wanted to be? Creepy thriller or jump-scare fest? Meh, pick a lane. 

There are moments when I could almost see the actors thinking, “Why am I doing this?” Same. Sorry, that's harsh, but when your main villain has a face that looks like a melted wax candle, it’s hard to take anything too seriously. And what’s with the owl noises right before every scare? Yes, 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘮𝘢𝘬𝘦𝘳𝘴, I see you trying to surprise me. It's like they 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed a make people jump playlist and hit shuffle. 

> Honestly, I was on the edge of my seat, not because of the suspense, but because I was this close to leaving. But hey, maybe I’m being too harsh. I did catch myself holding my breath when they were wandering around that dark cabin... kinda wished there was a light switch. Exactly like trying to find the last packet of peanuts in a dim airplane galley.

Oh, the characters. Remember when people in horror movies used common sense? Yeah, me neither. You legit want them to get caught just so they stop making bad decisions. Like, why are you going BACK into the spooky woods in the middle of the night? My main goal at this point is to finish my work and snuggle under my blanky with tea, not provoke ghosts. 

def run_away():
    if scared and danger_level > 5:
        print(Run faster than the flight to Florida when there's a seat sale)
    else:
        pout_because_bad_decision()

But, and it’s a big but, when the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 finally hit the credits, I was still thinking about it. Like, it just kinda lingered there, stuck in my head like that one annoying jingle you hear in every airport. I won’t be 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 it for a re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 anytime soon, but strangely, I didn't totally hate it. It's like enjoying turbulence because at least it’s something different, you know? If you give it a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, buckle up and don't forget the popcorn.
